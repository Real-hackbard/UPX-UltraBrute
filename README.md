UPX is an advanced executable file compressor. UPX will typically reduce the file size of programs and DLLs by around 50%-70%, thus reducing disk space, network load times, download times and other distribution and storage costs.

Download the latest version of UPX and copy the files to the destination folder.
The program requires the Win32bit or Win64bit version.

Download : https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/tag/v5.0.2

Programs and libraries compressed by UPX are completely self-contained and run exactly as before, with no runtime or memory penalty for most of the supported formats.

UPX supports a number of different executable formats, including Windows programs and DLLs, macOS apps and Linux executables.
UPX is free software distributed under the term of the GNU General Public License. Full source code is available.
UPX may be distributed and used freely, even with commercial applications.

### Overview:
UPX strengths in a nutshell:

secure: as UPX is documented Open Source since many years any relevant Security/Antivirus software is able to peek inside UPX compressed apps to verify them
excellent compression ratio: typically compresses better than Zip, use UPX to decrease the size of your distribution!
very fast decompression: more than 500 MB/sec on any reasonably modern machine
no memory overhead for your compressed executables because of in-place decompression
safe: you can list, test and unpack your executables. Also, a checksum of both the compressed and uncompressed file is maintained internally.
universal: UPX can pack a number of executable formats, including Windows programs and DLLs, macOS apps and Linux executables
portable: UPX is written in portable endian-neutral C++
extendable: because of the class layout it's very easy to add new executable formats or new compression algorithms
free: UPX is distributed with full source code under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2+; either under the pure GPLv2+, or (at your option) under the GPLv+2 with special exceptions and restrictions granting the free usage for all binaries including commercial programs as stated in the UPX License Agreement
You probably understand now why we call UPX the "Ultimate Packer for eXecutables"

## Commands:

### Compress
This is the default operation, eg. upx yourfile.exe will compress the file specified on the command line.

### Decompress:
All UPX supported file formats can be unpacked using the -d switch, eg. upx -d yourfile.exe will uncompress the file you've just compressed.

### Test:
The -t command tests the integrity of the compressed and uncompressed data, eg. upx -t yourfile.exe check whether your file can be safely decompressed. Note, that this command doesn't check the whole file, only the part that will be uncompressed during program execution. This means that you should not use this command instead of a virus checker.

### List:
The -l command prints out some information about the compressed files specified on the command line as parameters, eg upx -l yourfile.exe shows the compressed / uncompressed size and the compression ratio of yourfile.exe.

### Options:
-q: be quiet, suppress warnings-q 
-q(or -qq): be very quiet, suppress errors-q 
-q -q(or -qqq): produce no output at all
--help: prints the help--version: print the version of UPX
--exact: when compressing, require to be able to get a byte-identical file after decompression with option 
-d. [NOTE: this is work in progress and is not supported for all formats yet. If you do care, as a workaround you can compress and then decompress your program a first time - any further compress-decompress steps should then yield byte-identical results as compared to the first decompressed version.]
-k: keep backup files-o file

Compression Levels & Tuning
UPX offers ten different compression levels from -1 to -9, and --best.  The default compression level is -8 for files smaller than 512 KiB, and -7 otherwise.

Compression levels 1, 2 and 3 are pretty fast.

Compression levels 4, 5 and 6 achieve a good time/ratio performance.

Compression levels 7, 8 and 9 favor compression ratio over speed.

Compression level --best may take a long time.

Note that compression level --best can be somewhat slow for large files, but you definitely should use it when releasing a final version of your program.

Quick info for achieving the best compression ratio:

Try upx --brute --no-lzma myfile.exe or even upx --ultra-brute --no-lzma myfile.exe.
The option --lzma enables LZMA compression, which compresses better but is *significantly slower* at decompression. You probably do not want to use it for large files.

(Note that --lzma is automatically enabled by --all-methods and --brute, use --no-lzma to override.)

Try if --overlay=strip works.
For win32/pe programs there's --strip-relocs=0. See notes below.
Overlay Handling Options
Info: An "overlay" means auxiliary data attached after the logical end of an executable, and it often contains application specific data (this is a common practice to avoid an extra data file, though it would be better to use resource sections).

UPX handles overlays like many other executable packers do: it simply copies the overlay after the compressed image. This works with some files, but doesn't work with others, depending on how an application actually accesses this overlaid data.

  --overlay=copy    Copy any extra data attached to the file. [DEFAULT]

  --overlay=strip   Strip any overlay from the program instead of
                    copying it. Be warned, this may make the compressed
                    program crash or otherwise unusable.

  --overlay=skip    Refuse to compress any program which has an overlay.

Environment Variable:
The environment variable UPX can hold a set of default options for UPX. These options are interpreted first and can be overwritten by explicit command line parameters. For example:

    for DOS/Windows:   set UPX=-9 --compress-icons#0
    for sh/ksh/zsh:    UPX="-9 --compress-icons=0"; export UPX
    for csh/tcsh:      setenv UPX "-9 --compress-icons=0"
    
Under DOS/Windows you must use '#' instead of '=' when setting the environment variable because of a COMMAND.COM limitation.

Not all of the options are valid in the environment variable - UPX will tell you.

You can explicitly use the --no-env option to ignore the environment variable.
